Snow melt forecasting and agriculture – Brainstorm &amp; Analyze Data

The Colorado Basin River Forecast Center generates forecasts of streamflow from snow melt in
Western Colorado. These predictions are used by reservoir managers in the Colorado Basin to
decide on appropriate allocations to water users. Many crop producers in the area are particularly
dependent on these allocations because their crops depend, primarily, on irrigation. Planting
decisions (which crops and how much to plant) must be made at critical parts of the year, and they
can’t change their mind on this. We are interested in quantifying the value of forecast
improvements to farmers in this area. Using farming enterprise budget models and crop production
curves we would like to simulate revenue outcomes under a hypothetical set of forecasts with
various skills and compare them with revenues based on historical stream flows. While we have
historical forecasted and observed streamflow data, this task will require significant brainstorming
on how to simulate forecasts with various levels of predictive skill. We are looking for folks with
interest in the simulation of hydrologic datasets, forecasting, farming, or in brainstorming how to
best quantify the value of information.
